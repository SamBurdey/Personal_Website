# Sam's Personal Website

# Important

We are now live at https://samburdey.com/!  
Domain purchase and registry at https://www.namecheap.com/  
Free static hosting thanks to https://www.netlify.com/  

# Overview

The first attempt at a Resume website for myself.  
This will be a live adventure so expect the site be flux in design and apperance as we move forward.

# Technologies

To build this project, I'm started essentially from scratch with the fundamentals and working up.  
The first iteration is the creation of a static site for easy and cost effective hosting.  
To accomplish this, I am building the site using Bootstrap 5, a CSS Framework with the mix of standard HTML and JavaScript practices.

# Versioning

To help me on this journey, and to show users how far the website can grow, I wanted to implemented a type of Versioning history.  
Influenced by Sementic Versioning 2.0.0 ([The document link for that here](https://semver.org/)), I want to follow the framework of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (1.0.0). Where:  
1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.  

However, since we are the static stage, and may remain so, the MAJOR version may stay at 1 since we lack any API intergration as of (6/18/2022). 

# A Thanks

Thank you for being a part of this experience with me.
